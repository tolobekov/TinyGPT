## Understanding large language models

LLMs are deep neural networks trained on large data sets and designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-like text.<br>
LLMs utilize an architecture called the transformer, which allows them to pay selective attention to different parts of the input <br>
when making predictions, making themespecially adept at handling the nuances and complexities of human language. <br>
